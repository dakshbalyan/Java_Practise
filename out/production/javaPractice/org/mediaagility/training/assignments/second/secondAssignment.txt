Extend the functionality of this class. Categorise subclasses on the basis of some science or maths formulas or concepts.

Each subclass needs to have some overloaded constructors.

Prepare a main class which takes the parameters as Command Line Arguments and pass them for operations in these methods.

2. Replicate the above given class into an interface. Extend this interface to sub interface and implement them.

variable needs to be part of the interface.

Prepare a main class which takes the parameters as Command Line Arguments and pass them for operations in these methods.

3. Declare a String and reverse it without using StringBuffer.

4. Display abstraction using Factory method.
